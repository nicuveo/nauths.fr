Welcome!

This site has just been refurbished. The previous one was too old, far from
up-to-date, was too complicated, wasn't really used anymore... Some spring
cleaning was in order!

So, well, farewell to the previous iteration of this site, made with *Drupal*;
welcome to the new one, made with [*Jekyll*](http://jekyllrb.com/). Entirely
statically generated, without a database or anything, just pure and clean
*Ruby*.

Of course, the need from such a renovation stems from the will to write more
articles...
