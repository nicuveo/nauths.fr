Yesterday, I released the *1.0.0* version of [*SAW*](/en/{{ u.projs }}#saw).

The *master* branch now has a *1.0.0* tag on it, and the documentation is up to
date. And there was much rejoicing! It's not much, mainly because no one is
using it besides me, which means I have no issues to deal with, no weird bugs
that I can't seem to reproduce... But it doesn't mean that releasing it
publicly is devoid of meaning.


## Release early, release often

<div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 16px 16px">
  <img src="/img/saw/release.png" width="180px" style="margin: 0" alt="RELASE ALL THE THINGS" />
</div>

For the most part, releasing it brings me closure. It is out, it is tagged
*1.0.0*, it is in the wild, its checklist is empty: it is one less thing I have
to worry about. I tend to think about a new project every morning, and this one
is the very first that I've worked on alone that I feel I can release... Also,
I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to writing code, so releasing it
means that I'm finally starting to grasp the idea that nothing can ever *be*
perfect. Also, it is a way to do away with my "shyness" and accept the fact
that reviews and criticism is the way to grow and improve.

But the thing is... I know I'm missing the point. The goal of releasing early
and often is to improve with feedback, while I'm slowly starting to release
some "perfect" code with which I do not wish to bother anymore... But I've
started the year with the resolution to clear my mind and my desk by releasing
*all the things*: finish everything, write documentation, add tests, check the
coverage, write huge introspective release posts that are but an excuse to
reuse old memes... and that is, anyway, somehow, I think, a step in the right
direction.


## What's a "documentation"?

Which brings me (somehow) to the main subject I wanted to address in this small
*post-mortem*: writing documentation. It is a difficult subject, and much has
already been said about it. But writing
[*SAW*'s documentation](https://github.com/nicuveo/saw/wiki) made me realize a
few things that I had yet to understand by myself.

So, what's a "documentation"? You know, that's the... thing that goes along with
the code and that... explains the code I guess? "Documentation" is a broad
term, that can describe many things. The first thing I realized was: for whom
am I writing this? And why do I need to write things for them?

So, *SAW* is a library. Its goal is to be used by other developers who want to
benefit from the features it offers. My target is therefore: "other
developers". But that is yet again a broad term: to be more precise, I'd like
to target developers that would want to know how to use it, not hypothetical
developers willing to contribute to it. So, what I really want to do is explain
the public *API*.


## The code's not enough

For a long time, I strongly believed that code ought to be its own
documentation. That if your code it not readable and that one cannot easily
understand what it does by reading it, then there's something wrong with it, go
fix it! Documentation, in my mind, had only one purpose: explain the big
picture. Let the code speak for the details. I therefore used to be strongly
opposed to comments in the code, cluttering a perfectly readable file with
verbose documentation.

{% highlight c++ %}
//! Creates / open the database in given file
/*!
\param filename: the database file name
*/
void connect(std::string filename);
{% endhighlight %}

To this day I still believe in small, easily-readable, not cluttered by
comments code files. However, I've came to realize that there are things that
are worth documenting between the top-level big picture and the deep-down lines
of code. Those are, for instance, the guarantees of each method:

* this method will complete in `O(n)`;
* this method is thread-safe;
* this method has such side effect.

The more strict the language, the most this is enforced by the code itself. But
*SAW* is made with C++, which is
[far too permissive](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/const_cast)...


## Loose correlation

*SAW*'s documentation is therefore mostly a list of all the publicly accessible
class and methods, sometimes crudely explained and annotated, with a tutorial
that tries to highlight the big picture of it all. But, on top of being a bit
short, it suffers from the main issue of hand-written documentation (as opposed
to computer generated documentation): the slightest change in the codebase
needs to be reflected in it manually, because nothing is worse than a
misleading documentation.

This leads me to end this on an internal contradiction: I don't want comments
polluting my code files, but I would like the documentation to be fully
generated from the code... There's no good answer. I guess that's the price to
pay for still working with text files.

Well, anyway, here it is. Not perfect, but released. One down, a few more to
go!
