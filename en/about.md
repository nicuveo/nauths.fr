## Who am I?

Hi! I'm Antoine Leblanc (although I usually go by the nickname NicuvÃ«o). I'm a
software engineer at [Criteo](http://criteo.com) and the co-founder of Altribe,
a (now defunkt) video-game startup.

Amidst my main interests, one can notice a particular taste in programming
languages wizardry. I've been an enthusiastic C++ developer for years and I'm
now using C# at work, but I've also learnt / used / tried / played with several
others, including but not limited to: Python, Brainfuck, Haskell, Piet, Ruby,
Rust...

## What's with this site?

This small site I'll use as my tech blog, trying to write about the kind of
geeky stuff I discover / learn / do, be it about sanity-defying C++
preprocessing, semi-regular tilings or Haskell / Rust propaganda.

It also features a [small list of projects]({{ u.projs }}) on which I'm
working and that I plan to release at some (distant) point in the future.

## Is that all I do?

Nope! I also sing in [a choir]({{ u.chor }}) (come and listen
to us if you're in Paris!),
[try to write (in French)]({{ u.blog }}) about video games (and
the indie game scene, mostly), and draw some
[weird geometrical stuff]({{ u.devi }}).

If you're interested in contacting me / seeing more of what I do, you can:

  * read my aforementioned [game blog]({{ u.blog }}) (in French);
  * browse my [DeviantArt account]({{ u.devi }});
  * fork my [Github repositories]({{ u.gith }});
  * follow my [Twitter account]({{ u.twit }});
  * check my [LinkedIn profile]({{ u.l-in }});
  * download my [resume]({{ u.cv_e }});
  * send me an [e-mail]({{ u.mail }}).
