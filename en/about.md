## About me

Hi! I'm Antoine. I'm a software engineer at
[Hasura](http://hasura.io), and currently based in Dublin. I like
programming languages, and the things we can do with them. I mostly
use Haskell nowadays, but have experience with a lot of languages,
including esoteric ones such as Brainfuck or Piet. I like [electronic
music]({{u.bandcamp}}), I'm fascinated by
[symmetry]({{u.deviantart}}), and I'd love to challenge you at a game
of [Super Smash Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate).

My pronouns are [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themself). ![non-binary pride flag](/img/nbh.png){:class="img-responsive"}



## My work

I've been lucky to have the opportunities to explore a lot of
different facets of software engineering: I've done some game
development, a small amount of [demoscene_work](https://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/), I've been an
[SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) for
Google for a few years...

My current passion is the Haskell programming language, and I try when possible to share that enthusiasm:

- I created Google's [Haskell training classes](https://github.com/nicuveo/haskell-trainings) and facilitated them over a period of three years for several hundred attendees;
- I used to volunteer some of my time as a Haskell mentor for [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell);
- I sometimes [livestream]({{u.twitch}}) some Haskell work; usually the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

You can find some of my work and all my abandoned side-projects on [Github]({{u.github}}).
